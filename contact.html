    <p> Hello readers, Thanks for exploring our website! We hope our website could help spread more awareness about the LGBTQ community. We are a group of first year students at Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology and are still exploring the world of web development. This website is our first website, created at Makeathon 4.0, with basic knowledge of HTML and CSS. We are still learning, and hope to make even better websites in the future. Thanks for supporting us and we hope you like it!</p>
